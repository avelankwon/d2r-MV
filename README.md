# Diablo 2: Resurrected map viewer

Noob friendly FREE map reveal tool for Diablo 2 Resurrected.  
Use at your own risk, there is no warranty or responsibility taken for being penalised for using this.

This map hack is as simple as running an executable. It relies on a backend server that is offered for free but runs on donations.  

This tool is licenced under GPLv3.

The backend map server relies on this project [blacha/diablo2](https://github.com/blacha/diablo2/tree/master/packages/map). This tool uses a modified version of that executable to generate map data.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `d2rmap-vx.x.x.exe` and `settings.ini` files (found on the [releases page](https://github.com/joffreybesos/d2r-mapview/releases))
2. Launch D2R.
3. Run `d2rmap.exe` while in menus or in game.
4. You show see a 'Loading map data' message on the top left of the screen, this initial loading may take 10-15 seconds.
5. Make sure you press TAB to show the minimap, this map will only display when your minmap is displayed.

**Please note that running this map utility this way uses my freely hosted map server.
This server is getting hammered lately so it would be appreciated if you supported this project**.

**Map Legend**

- Green dot for player position
- White dots for normal monsters
- Large yellow dot for unique monsters
- Purple square for exits
- Yellow square for waypoints
- Most quest items should be marked with their respective icons
- Special unique monsters such as Radament and Summoner should have large red dots on their spawn location

**Other notes**

- You can exit the maphack with Shift+F10
- You can also right click the icon in the system tray.
- This MH will automatically exit when you exit D2R.
- Map download might be slow, just give it a second.

## Run from source

If you don't trust a precompiled executable, you can alternatively download and install <https://www.autohotkey.com/>  
Then you can run `src/d2r-map.ahk` directly from source.
This way you can verify the code yourself and ensure there are no hidden macros.

Do not accept executables for this from any other source!

## Configure

In `settings.ini` you should see some options to make configuration changes.

| baseUrl | http://diab.wikiwarsgame.com:8080 | URL of the map server, set to public server by default |
| maxWidth | 2000 | Maximum map image width in pixels, prevents oversized maps covering too much of the screen |
| scale | 1.1 | The global scale setting applied to all map images, press Shift + equals and Shift + minus to adjust in game|
| leftMargin | 20 | The left margin of the map image, set this to wider than your primary monitor to push it onto your secondary monitor. |
| topMargin | 20 | Top margin of map image |
| opacity | 0.5 | How transparent the map image should be, between 0 and 1 |
| alwaysShowMap | false | You can show hide map with TAB key, this setting will force it to always show |

| showNormalMobs | true | Set to false to hide normal non-unique monsters on the map |
| showUniqueMobs | true | Set to false to hide unique monsters on the map |
| normalMobColor | FFFFFF | Colour of the dot of normal monsters |

| playerOffset | 0x20AF660 | The static memory offset, when a new D2R client is released this will need to be updated |
| uiOffset | 0x20BF322 | The offset used to determine whether your minimap is open or not |
| readInterval |  10| How long to sleep between memory reads. Increase this if you are having performance problems |
| debug| false | Turn this one to increase the level of the logging, note this will create huse `log.txt` files |

## Map Server

### Use the hosted free map server

I offer a free to use map server on the internet, but it may be slow and occasionally go down.  
If you use this server please consider donating to help with server costs.

This free server comes preconfigured, simply use the default configuration in `settings.ini`

### Run your own map server

Alternatively you can host your own map server which I've also shared for free.  
Please refer to [SERVER.md](SERVER.md) for a full guide.

## Is it safe?

No one can say for sure. Blizzard do have Warden anti-cheat that will scan your computer for running processes and compare them against a blacklist. I accept no responsibility for any outcomes or usage of this tool. Use at your own risk!

## Troubleshooting

- A log file `log.txt` is generated in the same folder as the executable.
- You can also set debug logging to `true` in `settings.ini` for verbose logging.
- Go to the discord server if you need further help <https://discord.gg/qEgqyVW3uj>
- Tested and working on Diablo 2 Resurrected `1.0.67005`

If you are having trouble with the map server, refer to troubleshooting steps at [SERVER.md](SERVER.md)
