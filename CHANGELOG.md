Updated for the new Diablo 2 Resurrected client version 1.0.67005.
Needed new offsets.

- Map now shows the current play position with a bright green dot!

- Refactored code to run more efficiently
- Player position and rendered on separate GDI GUI layer for better performance
- Maps now rely on their native sizing with a maximum screen width rather than hard width
